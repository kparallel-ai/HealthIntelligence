//
//  Every stage before HealthInsightEngine is either HealthKit-agnostic
//  (PersonalBaselineEngine, HealthSignalDetector, HealthPatternDetector —
//  all pure functions over plain values, all unit-tested with synthetic
//  data) or already-tested per-day analysis (HealthAnalyzer). This file's
//  job is only to run that pipeline and phrase the result in plain
//  language; it introduces no new math of its own.
//
//  This is a deterministic system, end to end. No LLM interprets raw health
//  data anywhere in this pipeline — every number a HealthInsight cites
//  traces back to an arithmetic mean, standard deviation, or least-squares
//  slope over the user's own history, computed in PersonalBaselineEngine.
//
//  ------------------------------------------------------------
//  What's implemented vs. deliberately deferred
//  ------------------------------------------------------------
//
//  Implemented — reliably supportable today with a few weeks of HealthKit
//  history and no new infrastructure:
//
//    1. Meaningful baseline deviation   -> HealthSignalDetector.detectBaselineDeviation
//    2. Sustained trends                -> HealthSignalDetector.detectSustainedTrend
//    3. Recovery debt                   -> HealthSignalDetector.detectRecoveryDebt
//    8. Unusual physiological load       -> HealthSignalDetector.detectUnusualPhysiologicalLoad
//   10. Emerging deterioration           -> HealthPatternDetector.detectEmergingDeterioration
//   11. Bounce-back                     -> HealthSignalDetector.detectBounceBack
//
//  Deliberately deferred — each needs either months of longitudinal
//  history, a persisted episode store, or correlation-discovery
//  infrastructure this app doesn't have yet. Forcing them now, on a few
//  weeks of data, would produce confident-sounding but statistically
//  meaningless claims — exactly what this system is designed not to do:
//
//    4. Strain tolerance — needs many historical high-strain "episodes"
//       and their outcomes to characterize a personal dose-response curve.
//       One or two hard days isn't a curve.
//    5. Recovery time — needs episode segmentation (start/end of each
//       high-strain period) tracked over months. That needs a persisted
//       history store, not just a rolling HealthKit query recomputed on
//       launch (see HealthHistoryBuilder's cost notes).
//    6/7. Sleep <-> Strain relationships — genuine correlation analysis
//       needs many nights of paired data to avoid spurious correlations;
//       a handful of weeks produces noise dressed up as a finding.
//    9. Positive adaptation — needs workout-similarity matching (same rough
//       workload) plus a longitudinal comparison of physiological cost for
//       matched workloads over time.
//   12. Personal discoveries — general correlation mining across all
//       metric pairs. The least constrained capability and the easiest to
//       produce false positives from with limited history — the last one
//       to build, once 1-11 are validated against real data.
//
//  Extension point: HealthPatternKind and HealthSignalKind both have
//  comments marking where these would slot in without changing the shape
//  of anything upstream.
//
//  ------------------------------------------------------------
//  Minimum data requirements & confidence limitations
//  ------------------------------------------------------------
//
//  - A metric's baseline is only used for signals once
//    `MetricBaseline.isReliable` is true (>= 14 days of history). Below
//    that, MetricState still reports a raw deviation/percentile if it's
//    mathematically computable (>= 3 days), but HealthSignalDetector will
//    not turn it into a HealthSignal. `InsightsViewModel` surfaces this to
//    the user directly as "still building your baseline," rather than
//    hiding the wait silently.
//  - Every HealthSignal and HealthPattern carries a `confidence` (0...1)
//    driven by how much data backs it (baseline sample count, trend
//    consistency) — never by how dramatic the underlying number looks.
//  - Strain history is only computed for a short recent window (see
//    HealthHistoryBuilder.strainWindowDays) because it requires intraday
//    heart-rate samples, which are too expensive to pull for months at a
//    time. Recovery-debt and unusual-load reasoning about strain is
//    therefore inherently short-horizon, not a 45-day baseline like RHR,
//    sleep, or activity.
//
